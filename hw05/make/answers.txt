This file contains the answers to the two questions asked in the Make exercise
on http://elinux.org/EBC_Exercise_15_make

---------------------------------[ Question 1 ]---------------------------------

beagle$ gcc –g –c app.c –o app.o

In the above gcc command, name the target, dependency and command.

----------------------------------[ Answer 1 ]----------------------------------

Target     =  app.o
Dependency =  app.c
Command    =  gcc

---------------------------------[ Question 2 ]---------------------------------

What does the –c option (from the previous step) tell the compiler to do?

----------------------------------[ Answer 2 ]----------------------------------

Produce .o files only, rather than an executable.  The source files are compiled
but not linked.
