#HW05: Make, Kernel, Cross-Compiling, and The Cloud
![Demo Screenshot](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8521871/hosted/beaglebone/hw05/demo.png)

##Make
 - The `Makefile`, along with required files to run it, are included in the `make` folder.
 - The file `answers.txt` is also included.  This file contains the answers to the two questions on [the activity page](http://elinux.org/EBC_Exercise_15_make).

##Installing the Kernel Source
 - I was able to complete the "Installing Development Tools v4.4" exercise, and successfully installed the kernel on my BeagleBone.  The version installed was `4.4.23-bone14`.
 - I was unable to conmplete the DAS U-boot portion.  When compiling, the `make` command returns an error and I am unable to identify the problem, as everything before it worked (including the two other `make` commands).

##Cross-Compiling

 - I was able to cross compile without trouble.  Here is the output of the helloWorld program on both my host and my bone.

On the Host (Ubuntu VM):

Hello, World! Main is executing at 0x400596
This address (0x7fff4883db80) is in our stack frame
This address (0x601048) is in our bss section
This address (0x601040) is in our data section

On the BeagleBone:

Hello, World! Main is executing at 0x10495
This address (0xbea67c90) is in our stack frame
This address (0x21038) is in our bss section
This address (0x2102c) is in our data section

##Pushing to the Cloud
 - The `cloud` folder contains a `main.js` that reads two TMP101 temperature sensors every 5 seconds and sends the data to Phant running on `rose.engineer:8080`.
 - It is expected that one temperature sensor has `ADD0` grounded, and the other temperature sensor has `ADD0` connected to 3.3 volts.
 - The raw data can be [viewed here](http://rose.engineer:8080/streams/28KO4mjOAGfMabmO0al2coLo4jm).
 - A plot of the data can be viewed at the [JSFiddle here](http://jsfiddle.net/pLa9ncwv/).
