| [HW01](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw01) | [![HW01 Demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8521871/hosted/beaglebone/hw01/demoThumb.gif)](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw01) | An implementation of an Etch-A-Sketch in C++.  Allows<br>drawing, resizing of the Etch-A-Sketch area, and<br>clearing the Etch-A-Sketch area.  Click the image to<br>the left or the assignment number to visit this project.
| [HW02](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw02) | [![HW02 Demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8521871/hosted/beaglebone/hw02/demoThumb.gif)](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw02) | A new Etch-A-Sketch implementation.  Appears and<br>functions exactly the same as the one in HW01, except<br>this one's in Javascript instead of C++ and supports<br>inputs and outputs from the GPIO!
