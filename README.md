| [HW01](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw01) | [![HW01 Demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8521871/hosted/beaglebone/hw01/demoThumb.gif)](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw01) | An implementation of an Etch-A-Sketch in C++.  Allows<br>drawing, resizing of the Etch-A-Sketch area, and<br>clearing the Etch-A-Sketch area.  Click the image to<br>the left or the assignment number to visit this project.
| [HW02](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw02) | [![HW02 Demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8521871/hosted/beaglebone/hw02/demoThumb.gif)](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw02) | A new Etch-A-Sketch implementation.  Appears and<br>functions exactly the same as the one in HW01, except<br>this one's in Javascript instead of C++ and supports<br>inputs and outputs from the GPIO!

| [HW03](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw03) | [![HW03 Demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8521871/hosted/beaglebone/hw03/demoThumb.gif)](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw03) | Four projects, including: reading two TMP101 sensors<br>with a shell script, setting and waiting for an alert<br>on a TMP101 in JavaScript, reading a TMP006, and the<br>Etch-A-Sketch from the previous homework with an LED<br>matrix.

| [HW04](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw04) | [![HW04 Demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8521871/hosted/beaglebone/hw04/demoThumb.gif)](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw04) | Two separate projects.  The first uses `mmap()` to read<br>two GPIO pins and control the USR0 and USR1 LEDs.<br>The second allows an LED matrix to be controlled by a<br>web interface.  The interface allows drawing using all three<br>colors, as well as changing the brightness of the LED<br>matrix.  Click the image to the left or the assignment<br>number to visit this project.
| [HW05](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw05) | [![HW05 Demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8521871/hosted/beaglebone/hw05/demoThumb.png)](https://github.com/gfrung4/EmbeddedLinux/tree/master/hw05) | Three exercises (make, kernel, and cross-compiling) and a<br>demo on pushing data to the cloud.  The demo reads<br>two temperature sensors and sends the data to a Phant<br>server in the cloud.  The data can be retrieved later and<br>plotted using Plotly.
