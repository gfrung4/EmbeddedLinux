##Compile and Run
1. Download the **src.cpp** file and the **compile.sh** file and put them in the same directory on your Beaglebone.
2. Run the **compile.sh** script.  The code will be compiled and automatically run as well!  The code can be run again by running the **program** directly.

##Instructions
 - Use the arrow keys to control the Etch-A-Sketch.  An **X** will be placed wherever you move!
 - Press `[TAB]` to switch to the controls along the bottom, and press `[TAB]` again to switch back.
 - Use `[LEFT]` and `[RIGHT]` to move between the options at the bottom.
 - Use `[UP]` and `[DOWN]` to increase and decrease the **width** and **height** when they are selected.
 - Use `[ENTER]` to **clear** or **exit** when those options are selected.

##Notes
I was able to complete all of 1 through 6 on the homework.
